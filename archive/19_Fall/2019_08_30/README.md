## Research Presentations:
1. **The Life and Death of a Carding Kingpin**
   
    *Nathaniel Beckstead* @becksteadn
   
    > Roman Seleznev is continually likened to the Amazon of the carding industry. His online marketplaces for stolen credit cards forever changed computer crime and made him a prime target for the Secret Service. This talk will go through his life of hacking, wealth, and why he's getting out of prison in 2038.

In this presentation, I will go over some tricks to ensure you can always ask good technical questions. Take these tips and use them to participate in class and RITSEC! The person presenting will appreciate you for it.
